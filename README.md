# Neural_Network

A Transformer-Encoder-Model, a Long-Short-Term-Model and a Feed-Forward-Neural-Network. Designed to perform a multivariate regression.

Install the necessary requirements with

> pip install requirements

Run the project with

> python \_\_main\_\_.py

The main-file contains a pipeline to train and test the three machine learning models. Parameter and modelspecific hyperparameter are set in the beginning of the main (some default values are set in the file of the models themselves).

The training and testdata needs to be placed in the data directory, One .csv-trainingfile and one .csv-testingfile. The path to the data can be given in the parameter of the main.
